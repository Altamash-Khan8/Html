			<h2 id="fullstack">Full Stack:</h2>
			<p>What is a Full Stack Developer?
			The full stack developer definition is “someone who can work on both the back-end and front-end of systems.” 
			This means that they can develop fully fledged platforms (with databases, servers and clients) which don’t need other applications to function.
			What does a Full Stack Developer do?
			The Full Stack Engineer job description includes using a range of different technologies and languages (such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, C#) to develop applications. Full Stack Developers approach software holistically since they cater to both user experience and functionality.

			Full Stack Developer duties include:
			Participating in the design and creation of scalable software
			Writing clean, functional code on the front- and back-end
			Testing and fixing bugs or other coding issues
			Job brief
			We are looking for a Full Stack Developer to produce scalable software solutions. 
			You’ll be part of a cross-functional team that’s responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.

			As a Full Stack Developer, you should be comfortable around both front-end and back-end coding languages,
 			development frameworks and third-party libraries. You should also be a team player with a knack for visual design and utility.

			If you’re also familiar with Agile methodologies, we’d like to meet you.

			Responsibilities
			Work with development teams and product managers to ideate software solutions
			Design client-side and server-side architecture
			Build the front-end of applications through appealing visual design
			Develop and manage well-functioning databases and applications
			Write effective APIs
			Test software to ensure responsiveness and efficiency
			Troubleshoot, debug and upgrade software
			Create security and data protection settings
			Build features and applications with a mobile responsive design
			Write technical documentation
			Work with data scientists and analysts to improve software
			Requirements
			Proven experience as a Full Stack Developer or similar role
			Experience developing desktop and mobile applications
			Familiarity with common stacks
			Knowledge of multiple front-end languages and libraries (e.g. HTML/ CSS, JavaScript, XML, jQuery)
			Knowledge of multiple back-end languages (e.g. C#, Java, Python) and JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular, React, Node.js)
			Familiarity with databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB), web servers (e.g. Apache) and UI/UX design
			Excellent communication and teamwork skills
			Great attention to detail

			<p>What is mean stack?

			A MEAN stack developer is someone who has knowledge in some particular areas alone. MEAN stack development refers to the development process that falls within these particular set of technologies MongoDB, Expressjs, AngularJs, NodeJS. In simple words, MEAN stack developers are like JS-based application developers

MEAN Stack is a set of technologies that you can use to make a full-stack application.

M stands for MongoDB (No SQL database)
E stands for Express (a framework on top of Node)
A stands for Angular, a front end framework
N stands for Node, a backend framework
Two main advantages of MEAN stack are its scalability and the fact that it uses JavaScript only. Since they are all JavaScript, a good MEANstack developer is required to have extensive JS knowledge.

The primary functions of the MEAN stack technologies are:

Angular JS: Accept requests and display results to end-user
NodeJS: Handle Client and Server Requests
Express JS: Make requests to Database and return a response
MongoDB: Store and retrieve data.
As you can see, the correct name for this stack of technologies should be ANEM because it captures its stack order, but MEAN is more memorable.

To make it completely clear, a MEAN Stack Developer is a developer who only uses a certain stack of technologies to create a Full Stack Application.

More and more companies chose MEAN Stack Developers as their preferred choice of employees because they can make a full-stack application, and often their average salary is lower than that of a full stack developer. Let's talk about the responsibilities, requirements, and salaries of a mean stack developer.

MEAN Stack Developer Responsibilities, Requirements and Salaries
A MEAN stack developer job posting will look more or less the same as a Full Stack Developer one. You will be required to build frontend and backend systems, develop new modules and features, perform unit testing, coordinate with the web app team on API integrations, and follow a particular methodology like Agile.

Here are real-life MEAN Stack Developer examples in the form of job postings:

Job Description:

Hands-on Experience and manage Node js, Mongo DB, Angular js and Express js
Architect, Develop, test and deploy robust products that are fast, scalable and highly responsive
Design and maintain large and complex databases, both relational and non-relational databases
Establish, refine and integrate development environment tools and software as needed
Identify production and non-production application issues as a part of the deployment
Deploy applications on AWS cloud with the ability to quickly debug hosting related issues
Required skills:

Ability to contribute individually
Expertise in Complete Mean, Node js, Mongo DB, Angular js and Express js
Expertise in PHP, jQuery, MySQL, Symfony, OOPS
Experience in server management and AWS knowledge is mandatory
Ability to manage and lead a team of developers
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
Immediate joiners are appreciated
Best in industry salary
Qualifications B-Tech, M-Tech, MCA from reputed Colleges

Additional Information Other Skills: Committed, Good in Research.

The average MEAN stack developer salary in the USA is $71,628. The Entry-le</p>
